## Pixels

### White Noise

Here was the idea to cut the canvas into Pixels and letting them blink up randomly and fading out after. This canvas is split up into over 800'000 pixels.

### Pixelchad

My next idea was to 'pixelify' a given picture. I use the same method as my webcam sketch to get the pixel-infos of the picture. Then i make the drawn pixels bigger and out comes a distorted picture.
