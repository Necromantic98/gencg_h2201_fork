## Grids & Patterns

In terms of grids i had the idea of dots that move in a grid-like pattern. Additionally i wanted to make the dots move in different directions without touching each other. Another criteria that i wanted to implement was to set the amount of dots per axis. The dots should also have a fade-out-effect, since i lked it on my sollewit wall drawing. The last criteria for me was that it should loop perfectly, so that it doesnt have an end.

{% raw %}
<iframe src="content/day02/1/index.html" width="100%" height="450" frameborder="no"></iframe>
{% endraw %}

The black border around the canvas was necessary because of the loop-effect of the dots. I could have done it without the border, but this was the easier solution and far less time consuming.
