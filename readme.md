## Struggle with git

On the first day i learned quite a bit about git and its functions. Since noone has ever used git before, we had to do a bit of an unplanned introduction to github. It is pretty confusing at first, but if you get the hang out of it, its actually a nice tool.

## Sollewit: Wall drawing

I felt very inspirated on the Wall drawing from Sollewit and wanted to recreate it for myself.

{% endraw %}

The points are randomly generated on the canvas and connected to each other. To make a single point more visible, i made them a bit bigger than the lines.
On my next step i wanted to move them around and interacting with the border.

{% endraw %}

Here they are bouncing around inside the canvas. Additionally i made a function wich wich made the bouncing angle random.

{% endraw %}

After that i wanted to bring more color to the drawing. I made it so that it cycles through the color spectrum.

{% raw %}
<iframe src="content/day01/04/index.html" width="100%" height="450" frameborder="no"></iframe>
{% endraw %}

Or a variant that every point has a different color and the lines have a gradient.

{% endraw %}
