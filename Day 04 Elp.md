## Drawing machine

### Random Lines

The first idea that i had, was to set lines randomly across the canvas.

<iframe src="content/day04/1/index.html" width="100%" height="450" frameborder="no"></iframe>
{% endraw %}

### Line-Pattern

The next idea i had, was a line-based drawing machine as well. I set points around the canvas and connected two points, after that there is a counter which goes around the canvas. To create more complex patterns, i had to set different counter-increases to one or more sides of the canvas.

{% endraw %}

### Circle Pendulum

The last idea i had for this, was to draw a circle around the center and as the first circle is drawn, i drew another circle around the first and so on. Once finished there were some interesting patterns visible and pretty much all the time mirrored on the x-axis

{% endraw %}

I took this idea a step further and made a bunch of copies the whole circle-mess and started it from a different angle and/or different starting radius. Additionally i made a fade-out effect as well and gave it some color.
