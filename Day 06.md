## Faces

The only idea that i had, was to convert your webcam video into dots. The dots should get bigger the brighter a pixel is and smaller the darker the pixel is. If the webcam doesnt work in this frame, then the problem is, that it doesnt use the correct output. You can configure your browser to use the correct output. You also have to permit the browser to use the webcam, else it doesnt work. If you dont bother with the setting-hazzle, then ther is a Screenshot a the bottom to see what it should look like.
